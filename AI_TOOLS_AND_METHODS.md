## 2. AI Integration Methods

### 2.1 Agent-Based Architecture

DunGen utilizes a tool-based agent architecture where the AI model (primarily GPT-4o-mini) acts as the central coordinator that can:

1. **Understand user intent** from natural language requests
2. **Select appropriate tools** based on that intent
3. **Extract parameters** required for those tools
4. **Execute operations** via those tools
5. **Generate human-friendly responses** about the results

This architecture separates concerns effectively:
- The AI focuses on language understanding and user interaction
- Custom tools handle blockchain-specific operations
- The frontend manages UI and user experience

Example flow:

```
User Input → Speech-to-Text → AI Processing → Tool Selection → 
Parameter Extraction → Tool Execution → Response Generation → Text-to-Speech
```

### 2.2 Prompt Engineering Techniques

We employed several advanced prompt engineering techniques:

#### 2.2.1 Few-Shot Learning

Our prompts included examples of correct parameter extraction to guide the AI:

```
Example input: "Swap 10 RUSDT to RIF"
Extracted parameters: { fromToken: "RUSDT", amount: "10", toToken: "RIF" }
```

#### 2.2.2 Chain-of-Thought Prompting

We structured prompts to encourage step-by-step reasoning:

```
1. First, identify the operation type (swap, check balance, transfer)
2. Then, extract the relevant parameters for that operation
3. Next, validate the parameters for completeness
4. Finally, format the response appropriately
```

#### 2.2.3 Domain Constraint Specification

We explicitly limited the domain to improve accuracy:

```
Available tokens on Rootstock are: RBTC, DOC, RIF, SOV, BPRO, and RUSDT.
```

#### 2.2.4 Response Format Direction

We provided clear guidelines on how responses should be structured:

```
For swaps: Confirm the tokens and amount before executing
For balance checks: Provide the balance in a readable format
```

### 2.3 Parameter Extraction Patterns

We used a consistent approach to parameter extraction:

1. **Named Entity Recognition**: Identifying tokens, amounts, and addresses in free-form text
2. **Default Value Handling**: Setting reasonable defaults for optional parameters
3. **Contextual Enhancement**: Adding wallet address and other context automatically
4. **Validation Logic**: Ensuring parameters meet required formats before execution

## 3. Model Training and Fine-Tuning

While we primarily used off-the-shelf models, we enhanced their performance through:

### 3.1 Synthetic Data Generation

We created a dataset of 200+ example queries and their expected parameter extractions to test model performance and select the optimal model.

### 3.2 Prompt Optimization

We iteratively improved prompts based on:
- Error analysis of misinterpreted queries
- User testing feedback
- Performance metrics (accuracy, latency, cost)

Our prompt evolution tracked improvements across multiple versions:

| Version | Focus | Key Improvements |
|---------|-------|------------------|
| v1 | Basic intent recognition | Identified operation type |
| v2 | Parameter extraction | Added token name recognition |
| v3 | Error handling | Improved handling of ambiguous requests |
| v4 | Response quality | Enhanced conversational tone |
| v5 (final) | Personality | Added quirky, fun personality traits |

## 4. Custom AI Tools Development

### 4.1 GOAT SDK Integration

We extended the GOAT SDK to create custom tools for Rootstock interactions:

```typescript
createTool(
  {
    name: "swap_tokens",
    description: "Swap one token for another on Rootstock",
    parameters: z.object({
      fromToken: z.string().describe("The token to swap from"),
      amount: z.string().describe("The amount to swap"),
      toToken: z.string().optional().describe("The token to swap to"),
      walletAddress: z.string().describe("The wallet address to use for the swap"),
    }),
  },
  async (parameters) => {
    // Tool implementation
  }
)
```

### 4.2 AI-Generated UI Components

We used AI to generate specialized UI components for our themed environment:

1. **Component Specification**: We described the desired component behavior and appearance
2. **AI Generation**: Claude generated the complete React component with Tailwind styling
3. **Integration**: We integrated the component with minimal modifications
4. **Iteration**: We refined the component through additional AI-assisted iterations

## 5. Multimodal AI Integration

Our platform combines multiple AI modalities:

### 5.1 Speech Recognition

We use the browser's SpeechRecognition API to capture user voice input:

```typescript
recognition.onresult = (event) => {
  const text = event.results[0][0].transcript;
  setIsProcessing(true);
  sendToAgent(`${text}: my wallet address is ${walletAddress}`);
};
```

### 5.2 Text-to-Speech

We use ElevenLabs' API to convert AI responses to natural-sounding speech:

```typescript
const generateElevenLabsTTS = async (text: string) => {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/${voiceId}/stream`,
    {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        Accept: "audio/mpeg",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "xi-api-key": apiKey,
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        text,
        model_id: "eleven_monolingual_v1",
        voice_settings: { stability: 0.5, similarity_boost: 0.5 },
      }),
    }
  );
  
  const audioBlob = await response.blob();
  const audioUrl = URL.createObjectURL(audioBlob);
  audioRef.current.src = audioUrl;
  audioRef.current.play();
};
```

### 5.3 Visual Feedback

AI responses are integrated with the visual interface through:

1. **Speech Bubbles**: Text appears above the user's character
2. **Visual Cues**: Animations indicate when the AI is processing
3. **Themed Elements**: Response style matches the current visual theme

## 6. Performance and Optimization

### 6.1 Model Selection Strategy

We implemented a dynamic model selection strategy:

```typescript
async function processQuery(query: string) {
  try {
    // First try with faster, cheaper model
    const result = await callGPT4Mini(query);
    if (isValidResult(result)) return result;
    
    // Fall back to more capable model if needed
    return await callGemini(query);
  } catch (error) {
    // Final fallback to ensure user gets a response
    return generateFallbackResponse(query);
  }
}
```

### 6.2 Caching and Memoization

We cache common queries and their results to improve response time:

```typescript
const memoizedProcess = useMemo(() => {
  const cache = new Map();
  
  return (query: string) => {
    const normalizedQuery = normalizeQuery(query);
    if (cache.has(normalizedQuery)) {
      return cache.get(normalizedQuery);
    }
    
    const result = processQuery(normalizedQuery);
    cache.set(normalizedQuery, result);
    return result;
  };
}, []);
```

### 6.3 Parallel Processing

For complex operations, we use parallel processing to improve response time:

```typescript
async function processComplexQuery(query: string) {
  const [intentResult, tokensResult] = await Promise.all([
    extractIntent(query),
    extractTokens(query)
  ]);
  
  return combineResults(intentResult, tokensResult);
}
```

## 7. Evaluation and Metrics

### 7.1 Performance Metrics

| Success Rate | >98% | 98.9% | Operations completed successfully |
| User Satisfaction | >4.5/5 | 4.7/5 | From user testing feedback |

### 7.2 Error Analysis

We categorized and tracked errors to identify improvement areas:

| Error Type | Frequency | Mitigation |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| Misunderstood Tokens | 3.2% | Added token list to prompt |
| Incorrect Amounts | 1.8% | Added validation rules |
